Hello! I am an undergraduate student studying math and computer science at the University of British Columbia. 

I am interested in optimization for deep learning, deep learning theory and generative models. 

My goal is to understand neural network training dynamics and why adaptive optimizers are so effective for modern deep learning problems e.g. LLMs. On the application side, I am interested in generative models e.g. diffusion and flow matching to enhance discovery in scientific fields.
